# Unit-14_Reverse_Engineering_HMWK


As a developer, I want to be able to walk through a breakdown of the codebase for any application. With this understanding, I can use it as a basis as a starting point for all new projects going forward. 

This is especially true for me, as an employee of GoDaddy, where there are numerous projects happening simultaneously with internal and external partners and departments. Most times, this will be the first time I have seen this code. Allowing me to dissect the code and understand it by myself and saving higher level questions for team members, which fits perfectly with the AGILE system utilized by GoDaddy software engineers.
